# PSBrute

## Installation

Clone this repository to a directory that's in your `$env:PSModulePath`. Note that the cloned directory **must be called `BRUTE`**, which is also the module's name.

```
git clone https://github.com/MatejKafka/FEL-PSBrute BRUTE
```

Now, the module should be importable by calling `Import-Module BRUTE`, or just invoking one of the exported functions.
